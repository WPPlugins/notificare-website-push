== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to sign up to Notificare to use this plugin? =

Yes. You can also try it for 30 days before considering a paid plan. You can upgrade or cancel it at anytime.

= Do I need a Premium Support account? =

No. But it is recommended. Our Premium Support plans allow you to contact our engineering team 24/7 through our help desk at support.notifica.re.
